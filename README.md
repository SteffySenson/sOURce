A Realtime Web based chatting app using HTML, CSS &amp; Django with a little bit of AJAX<br>

This app currently features -<br>

 -A web based app<br>
 -Able to send messages to a user using a username and a unique number(can be phone number or any digits)<br>

Thought Process<br>
---------------<br>

This is my first attempt at building a Website using Django. I have researched about basic requirements needed for projects using Django from tutorials and documentation. I used VSCode for the project. 'sOURce' seems like an ideal name for the project, since I had to learn it from the scratch ;) and also the highlighted 'OUR' is source gives a feeling of belonging in using the webchat. The simple interface makes it easier for user to navigate through the site. I am working on the rest of the features to be added to the webapp.

Soon, the app will be able to -<br>

-Delete and edit the previous messages.<br>
-User Authenticated for login.<br>
-Messages should be saved, and retrievable later when user logs in again.<br>
